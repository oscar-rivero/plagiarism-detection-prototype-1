When we speak about microeconomics, we examine how organizations, creating a structure of market, interrelate within a market to form a market system. These organizations include public and private players with diverese categorizations, typically operating under lack of tradable units and light government regulation. The item which is traded may be a tangible product such as food or a service such as insurance, dry cleaning, or sporting events.
