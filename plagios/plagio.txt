The literature of Ethiopian historiography has been dominated traditionally by theology of christianity and the chronology of the Bible. There was also ample influence from Islamic, pagan and external components from within the Horn of Africa and beyond. Diplomatic binds with Christendom were established in the Roman era under Ethiopia's first Christian monarch, Ezana of Axum, in the 4th century AD, and were revived in the Late Middle Ages with delegations traveling to and from medieval Europe. Building on the tradition of ancient Greek and Roman historical scripts about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical Prester John, who was viewed as a potential helper against Islamic powers. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval Islamic historiography and even Chinese encyclopedias, travel literature, and official histories.
